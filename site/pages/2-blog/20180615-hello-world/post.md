summary: |-
    Every new beginning needs a first step — and traditionally, it starts with these two words: **Hello, World!**

    This simple phrase has become a time-honored tradition in programming. It’s the output of the very first program most developers write when learning a new language, a framework, or — like now — setting up a new site.

## Why "Hello World"?

The origin of the phrase dates back to 1978, when Brian Kernighan used it as an example in the book *The C Programming Language*. Since then, it has become the universal symbol of a fresh start, signaling that everything is working as expected.
