## Nature’s small details

It’s easy to overlook how much beauty is packed into a few square meters of green. Leaves swaying, sunbeams flickering through branches, or even just the calm of still water.

> “In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.”

Whether it’s five minutes or fifty, taking time to unplug and be present outdoors can make all the difference.
